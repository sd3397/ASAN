        <p class="autism-text">Autism is a development disability that affects how we see the 
            world around us. Autism is not a type of condition or disease and is a normal part 
            of who we are. People who are autistic are born that way and are autistic their whole 
            lives. Autism falls heavily onto a spectrum of many different symptoms and quirks. 
            There is no one way to be autistic, as many autistic people will act completely 
            different from each other. Despite this, there are many common symptoms that all 
            autistic individuals posses at some capacity.</p></div>

    <p class="autism-text">Masking is when an autistic individual hides or suppress

    <h3 class="h3-red">Why do autistic people mask?</h3>
    <p class="autism-text">Many autistic people feel the need to mask to avoid being 
        persecuted for their symptoms and to be more easily accepted by others</p></div>

        <h3 class="h3-red">What does it look like?</h3>
        <p class="autism-text">Masking can appear as suppressing stimming or using 
            more “acceptable” stims to use in public. It could also be forcing eye 
            contact or physical contact, despite the discomfort it might cause. 
            Many individuals will practice script they go through for different 
            types of social interactions. <br><br> Masking can feel like a personal 
            shield when individuals feel uncomfortable with how others perceive

            Despite the relief it can bring people from not standing out too far from the 
            crowd, Depression, anxiety, and internalized ableism can all sprout from 
            consistent masking. Many will wonder if they are only accepted for how 
            they act instead of who they actually are.</p></div>

    <p class="autism-text">Autism doesn't extend to just childhood, but last a 
        person entire life. However, most of the focus is on autistic children, 
        which leaves a lot of problems for autistic adults, especially in the 
        modern day workplace. Here are some articles explaining how to help 
        any autistic coworkers you might meet. Remember, even if they sometimes need help</p>

    <h2>Our Campaign</h2>

    <div>
        <p class="campaign-text">Our campaign strives to create a better form of communication 
            with those on the autism spectrum and those who are not. Most of the information 
            we receive of autistic individuals only cover how they might act as children, 
            not adults. Because of this, many assume it either goes away, or is grown out of. 
            Rather than over explaining Autism and its many variables, which could isolate 
            and ostracize members of the community, our campaign gives simple tips to help 
            communicate and understand. The shirts and posters serve to help put the 
            individual in the mindset of an autistic individual, and how they interrupt 
            different actions and ideas.</p>
